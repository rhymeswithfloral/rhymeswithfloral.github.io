<p>This is my GitHub blog. It will be devoted to all my TA work with HIST3907 and my work for the graduate course, HIST5702. I'll be updating my project progress and various other GitHubby things here. Looking for my other blog? You'll find a link to it at the bottom of the page under Beyond GitHub in the menu.</p>

  <strong><p class="update">03.12.2016</p></strong>
  <p>The pun is strong in <a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/hist5702w_notebook/blob/master/RegEx_TheDigitalSwiffer.md">this one</a>. Just uploaded a reflection on how it can take three, and sometimes maybe more than three, attempts to figure out the best process for cleaning data with regular expressions. I'm sure the lessons that I learned while trying to figure out the best method for turning an HTML file into a table-ready CSV file with RegEx, will be applicable in other digital history tasks. However, I gotta say the amount times I wasting doing this is really stressing me out. I'm going to go laugh at my puns to cheer to me up.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">03.07.2016</p></strong>
  <p>Still some exercises and tutorials from HIST3709o that I intend to finish up, but today I finished most of the exercises for Module 5 that I had started over the weekend. Nothing to scary, for the most part it was all stuff I was very familiar. Type Connections was fun to play with, I'm well versed in the importance of typography, but that little matchmaking game was a nifty way to talk about it. You can find the product of module 5 <a href="myfontchoice2.html">here</a>.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">02.29.2016</p></strong>
  <p>That time Open Refine tweeted about my OpenRefine tutorial:</p>
  <div style="margin-left:30px;"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RT <a href="https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo">@electricarchaeo</a>: &#39;All data is dirty&#39; <a href="https://twitter.com/pricklyplant">@pricklyplant</a> on OpenRefine <a href="https://t.co/3MEavamwcw">https://t.co/3MEavamwcw</a></p>&mdash; OpenRefine (@OpenRefine) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenRefine/status/705072905449775104">March 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

  <strong><p class="update">02.25.2016</p></strong>
  <p>Working on the map for my HIST5702w project, currently testing out the options for sharing a <b>CartoDB</b> map, one of the options for sharing is a CartoDB.js which allows me to embed my map into an external website. You can view it <a href="\hist5702w_cartoDB.html">here</a>. Lots of fiddling left to do.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">02.17.2016</p></strong>
  <p>GitHub should move its "edit" button away from its "Delete" button. It is heart attack inducing.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">02.17.2016</p></strong>
   <p>The wonderful feeling that comes from solving a problem in an entirely new way. This I experienced with setting up Stanford NER on my Windows 10 PC. When simply unzipping the file and double-clicking on the <i></i>ner-gui.bat</i> didn't work, I did a quick search and found a <a href="https://gist.github.com/troyane/c9355a3103ea08679baf">script</a> for setting up NER for Python. I didn't use the entire script because at the time I was fairly certain the problem had to do with Java, So I just used lines 11-19. From there I fiddled a bit with some of the steps laid out in the <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/supporting%20materials/ner/#pc-users">HIST3907o exercise for NER</a>. The rest of my success story can be found <a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/hist5702w_notebook/WinningNER.md">here</a> as well as the reference materials I used.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">02.09.2016</p></strong>
    <p>Two more tutorial relfections added to my HIST5702w open-notebook. The class has been working through the Programming Historian lessons and I think we've all come to realize that it is not written for the newbies or beginners. Whether subconciously or not, the authors have these lessons had a lot of preconceptions about the audience they were writing for. So begins the week of <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2016/02/02/can-we-fix-it-yes-we-can/" alt="Can we fix it? Yes, we can!"> DH Annotate</a>. With the browser extension <b>Hypothesis.io</b> in hand, we'll mark-up Programming Historian with our thoughts and quibbles.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">01.28.2016</p></strong>
    <p>I've got my HIST5702w open-notebook repository up and <a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/hist5702w_notebook/">running</a>. I'll be adding reflections and updates to that folder over the course of the semester. Discussing the tutorials from the Programming Historian as well as the various digressions and topics that we touch on in class. I'll also be using the folder to discuss project updates as well. My first reflection discusses Markdown and the nature of open research.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">01.25.2016</p></strong>
    <p>Still working through the RegEx and OpenRefine modules for my TA course. RegEx will forever confuse me I think. I've also come up with an idea for my final project for HIST5702w, just need to see if I can track down the necessary information to make it doable</p>
  <strong><p class="update">01.14.2016</p></strong>
    <p>Completed the text encoding excercise of Module 3, no hiccups found! Results of the TEI excercise can be found <a href="/research-notebook-demo/Module3-TEI-hist3907/Transcription_Binnsvol013-005_10.xml">here</a>.
  <strong><p class="update">01.07.2016</p></strong>
    <p>Working through the second half of Module 2, involves API and JSON scripts but I seem to be bumping into a few obstacles when I attempt to download search results from Canadiana.org. My notes on this module can be found <a href="http://rhymeswithfloral.github.io/CanadianaAPI_notes.html">here</a>.</p>
  <strong><p class="update">01.04.2016</p></strong>
    <p>Working on Module 2 of the course I am TAing for. Involves scraping a digital database with OutWit Hub. Notes on this can be found <a href="CWGCRecordSearch_notes.html">here.</a></p>
  <strong><p class="update">12.27.2015</p></strong>
    <p>Even the easy route isn't all that simple, but it looks pretty damn good now. It matches my blog!</p>
  <strong><p class="update">12.26.2015</p></strong>
    <p>After some fits and starts with a couple of other methods, a GitHub webpage is born. Page generated, time to play with the layout.</p>

<a id="course-work" class="anchor" href="#course-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Work</h3>
  <h4>HIST3907o (TA)</h4>
    <p class="work"><a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/research-notebook-demo">Research-Notebook-Demo</a> repository for working through and testing the modules for HIST3907o. There are two additional repositories that I created while working through these modules: <a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/demo">Demo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/hello-world">Hello-World</a>. Neither of which contain any real information of interest, however, if you'd like to watch a video of some cows enjoying a cover of Royals by Lorde played on the trombone then you might like to drop by Demo.</p>
  <h4>HIST5702w</h4>
    <p class="work"><a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/hist5702w_notebook/">HIST5702w-Notebook</a></p>
    <p class="work">The project grows and grows and grows. You can check out its growth at my other repository <a href="https://github.com/rhymeswithfloral/hist5702w_project">HIST5702w-Project</a>. There are a couple rough copies of the twine that <a href="https://github.com/emilykkeyes">@emilykkeyes</a> and I are working on. This is part of what the NER was for.</p>
    <p class="work">I am using Stanford NER to pull out names and places from 17th century pamphlets written by or associated with John Stearne and Matthew Hopkins, these will provide reference points for a large project that will focus on tracking the movements of these two men between 1644 and 1648. Setting up NER was a bit difficult because the majority of my DH work is done a Windows 10 PC, however, I managed to problem solve my way through NER's setup! My steps can be found in my HIST5702w-Notebook.</p>
