          <h3>Module 2</h3>
            <p><strong><a href="http://eco.canadiana.ca/"<strong>Canadiana</strong></a> API Excercise 3</p>
            <p><strong>Search specifications:</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>Term:</strong> "Ottawa"</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>Date Range:</strong> 1800-1900</p>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
        <p>I followed the steps to build the folder from scratch using GitBash, CoreUtils and Wget, however when I went entered "canadiana-2.sh" into GitBash there was no response.
        I watched Profressor Graham's video about the Canadiana API excercise and attempted again using the zipped folder he created, but once again there was no response from GitBash.
        At this point I decided to start fresh and work from scratch again and created another folder for Module 2 but once again - no response.
        However, when I double clicked on "canadiana-2.sh" in my Module 2 folder the program started. Due to some external issues, the files created by running the canadiana-2.sh program were empty.</p>
        <p>The canadiana-2.sh shell script can be found in the Research-Notebook-Demo repository.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that I was working on a machine with Windows 10, there was a period of trial and error to get through this.
        In order to make this program work what needed to be done was changing the "jq" in the Canadiana.sh file to "./jq" and using "./canadiana-2.sh" as my command in GitBash.
        I've uploaded my first attempt at editing the Canadiana shell script, which wasn't working, as well as the version with the edits that did work.</p>
