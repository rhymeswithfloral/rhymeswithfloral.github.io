{"name":"Rhymes with Floral","tagline":"Things Talk: The GitHub Edition","body":"### Welcome\r\nThis is my GitHub blog. It will be devoted to all my TA work with HIST3907 and my work for the graduate course, HIST5702. I'll be updating my project progress and various other GitHubby things here. Looking for my other blog? You'll find a link to it at the bottom of the page under [**Contact**](/#contact)\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nBlog: [Things Talk](http://thingstalk.wordpress.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
